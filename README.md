This mini-project showcases an interactive and visually appealing collection of colorful sticky notes, developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. 
These sticky notes emulate a realistic design, complete with vibrant colors, enhancing the overall user experience. Users can engage with these digital sticky notes by clicking on them,
and a double-tap gesture allows for quick deletion of the selected note, mimicking real-world sticky note behavior.

Key Features:

Colorful Variety: There is a range of predefined vibrant colors, making note-taking and organization more visually appealing.
Interactive Functionality: Clicking on a create note button allows users to create a new note.
Concise Note-Taking with 100-Character Limit: The sticky notes in this project have a character limit of 100 letters.  
 By setting a limit on the text length, users are prompted to prioritize their notes, making the overall experience more organized and efficient.
Easy Deletion: A double-tap gesture enables users to swiftly delete a selected sticky note, providing convenience and efficiency.
Engaging User Experience: The combination of realistic design elements, interactive features, and colorful options creates an engaging and enjoyable user experience.
